## Neuron
Looks like an interesting approach to [zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de) to build a stash of zettelkasten sitting on github.
The good part is that it can be accessed from everywhere. 
Plus totally web based.
No need to install anything.
Gives an instant view of the files. 

Downside:
- Does not instantly upload (no big deal)

## Protocol:
- Clone this repo
- Use the folder where this repo sits as the zettelkasten
- If you need to build locally, then install neuron. 
- Otherwise, when inspiration strikes, come to the repo on the web
- Search, and work with something like [hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io) or tonnes of other tools to mix and mash markdown files
